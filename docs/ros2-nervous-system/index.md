# ROS 2 as Robotic Nervous System

Welcome to the ROS 2 as Robotic Nervous System module. This section explores how ROS 2 functions as a middleware nervous system that connects AI decision-making to physical robot control.

## Learning Goals

In this module, you will:

- Understand how ROS 2 enables communication between robotic components
- Build mental models of nodes, topics, and services
- Learn how to bridge Python-based AI agents to robot controllers
- Understand humanoid robot structure using URDF

## Chapters

1. [ROS 2 Fundamentals](./ros2-fundamentals) - Core concepts of ROS 2 architecture
2. [ROS 2 Communication with Python Agents](./python-agents) - Connecting AI agents to robot controllers
3. [Humanoid Modeling with URDF](./urdf-modeling) - Understanding robot structure with URDF
