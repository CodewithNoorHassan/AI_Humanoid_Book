# API Contracts: Digital Twin Module (Gazebo & Unity)

This directory contains the API contracts and interface specifications for the digital twin module components.

Since this module focuses on educational content about digital twin technologies (Gazebo physics simulation, virtual sensor modeling, and Unity-based human-robot interaction), the "contracts" here refer to the educational interface specifications and learning outcomes rather than traditional software APIs.
