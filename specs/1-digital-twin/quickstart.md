# Quick Start: Digital Twin Module (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview
This quick start guide provides a high-level introduction to the digital twin concepts covered in this module. Digital twins are virtual representations of physical robots that mirror their real-world behaviors, properties, and responses in simulated environments.

## Learning Path
This module consists of three interconnected chapters designed to build your understanding progressively:

### Chapter 1: Physics Simulation with Gazebo
Learn how to create realistic physics simulations using Gazebo, including:
- Setting up gravity and environmental parameters
- Configuring collision detection and response
- Modeling humanoid motion dynamics
- Tuning solver parameters for stability

### Chapter 2: Virtual Sensor Modeling
Explore how to simulate various sensors with realistic characteristics:
- LiDAR simulation with appropriate noise models
- Depth camera simulation with realistic imperfections
- IMU simulation including drift and calibration effects
- Integration of multiple sensor types in simulation

### Chapter 3: Unity for Human-Robot Interaction
Discover how Unity creates high-fidelity visual environments for interaction:
- Creating realistic materials and lighting
- Building intuitive interaction interfaces
- Optimizing performance for real-time rendering
- Connecting Unity with other simulation tools

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
