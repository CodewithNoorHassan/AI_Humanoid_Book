# API Contracts: Isaac AI Brain Module (NVIDIA Isaac™)

This directory contains the API contracts and interface specifications for the Isaac AI Brain module components.

Since this module focuses on educational content about Isaac technology (Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2 for humanoid navigation), the "contracts" here refer to the educational interface specifications and learning outcomes rather than traditional software APIs.
